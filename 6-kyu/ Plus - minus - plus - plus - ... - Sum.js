/**
 * Given an array [x1, x2, ..., xn] determine whether it is possible to put + or - between the elements and get an expression equal to sum. Result is boolean

2 <= n <= 22
0 <= xi <= 20
-10 <= sum <= 10
Example
arr = [1, 3, 4, 6, 8]

sum = -2

1 + 3 - 4 + 6 - 8 = -2

Result is: true

Notes
If it is impossible to find a solution then you should return false.
